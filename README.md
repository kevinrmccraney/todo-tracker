# Todo-tracker
### Overview

[**Todo-tracker**](https://github.com/kevinrmccraney/todo-tracker) is a command-line todo tracking utility. The script generates .todo files and places them in the current working directory. If you use a GUI, it incentivizes you to keep your working space clean. It was built over three days or so, and is my first attempt at working in `bash`.

### Technologies Used
